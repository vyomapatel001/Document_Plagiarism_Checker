Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence concerned with the development of algorithms that can learn from data.
Such systems evolve with time by learning patterns in datasets without direct instructions.
In many machine learning tasks, neural networks are applied due to their brain-like structure.
Models become more effective as they are trained with more data, improving their predictions.
