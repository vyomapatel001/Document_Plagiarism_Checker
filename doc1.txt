Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data.
These systems improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
Neural networks, which are inspired by the human brain, are commonly used in machine learning applications.
The more data a model receives, the better its ability to generalize and make accurate predictions.
